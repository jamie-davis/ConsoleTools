"Passed" indicates the result returned by TestResultScanner. "File Exact Match" indicates      
whether the received file exactly matches the approved file on disk.                           
                                                                                               
The scanner's comparison is line-ending agnostic, so it will report a match even if the line   
endings are different. One of the test files has deliberately been written with line ending    
differences to test this, and should show up as a pass but not an exact match.
